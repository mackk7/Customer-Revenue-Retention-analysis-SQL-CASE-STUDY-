# Customer Revenue & Retention Quality Analysis  
**SQL Business Case Study (PostgreSQL)**

---

## Executive Summary

Despite rising order volume, revenue growth is constrained by **flat Average Order Value (AOV)** and **high early customer churn**.  
SQL analysis shows that **retained customers generate 10 times higher lifetime value** than one-time buyers ( 2406 to 24191 ).  
At the current scale, a small increase in retention generates **disproportionate incremental revenue** that top 10 customers hold 37.44 % of total revenue.
Early customer behavior—especially first-month spend—is a strong predictor of long-term value.

##NOTE : DATA IS SYNTHETIC AND GENERATED BY PYTHON

**Final Recommendation:**  
Prioritize **retention and post-first-purchase engagement** over scaling acquisition or price-led strategies.

## 1. Business Context
The company's **stagnant revenue growth despite growing order volume** indicates a structural growth problem rather than a lack of traffic.

1. Raise AOV  
2. Enhance the quality of customer retention  
3. Grow your clientele  

Instead of using surface metrics, this project employs **SQL-driven analysis** to assess each lever based on **revenue quality, customer behavior, and ROI**.

## 2. Data Overview

Simulated but behaviorally realistic e-commerce data reflecting real-world patterns such as repeat purchasing, revenue concentration, and churn.

**Tables used:**
- `customers` — customer attributes (city, identity)
- `orders` — transaction-level data (order date, order value)
- `order_items` — product-level data (category, quantity, price)

---

## 3. Analytical Approach

The analysis is intentionally structured to move from:

**Descriptive metrics → Diagnostic insights → Financial impact → Business decisions**

Each section answers a *decision*, not just a metric.

---


## 4. Revenue & Growth Diagnostics

**Objective:** Determine whether stagnation is driven by pricing, volume, or customer behavior.

**Key Findings**
- Order volume increases over time
- AOV remains largely flat
- Revenue growth is inconsistent month-over-month

**Decision Implication**  
Revenue stagnation is **not solved by more orders alone**. Price-led growth is constrained, shifting focus toward customer quality and retention.

---

## 5. Customer Behavior & Revenue Dependency

**Objective:** Identify who generates revenue and how risky the dependency structure is.

**Key Findings**
- Repeat customers generate a disproportionate share of revenue
- Significant drop-off occurs after the first purchase
- Revenue is concentrated among a small subset of customers

**Decision Implication**  
The business is **exposed to revenue volatility** and must reduce dependence on one-time buyers by improving repeat behavior.

---

## 6. Retention Quality & Churn Analysis

**Objective:** Measure retention depth, not just retention rate.

**Key Findings**
- Early churn after the first purchase is high
- Retained customers exhibit higher purchase frequency and value
- Cohort analysis shows retention decay over time
- Several high-value customers show prolonged inactivity
  "customer_type"	   "customer_count"	"avg_clv"	"total_revenue"
"retained_customer"	     91	            24191.52	2201428.11
"one_time_customer"	      7	            2406.43	  16845.00

Churn rate by first purchase With 7 first purchase the churn rate is 100% 

**Decision Implication**  
Growth inefficiency stems from **poor post-acquisition retention**, not insufficient acquisition. Targeted win-back and lifecycle engagement present immediate upside.

---

## 7. First Purchase Quality & Lifetime Value

**Objective:** Test whether early engagement predicts long-term revenue.

**Key Findings**
- Higher first-month spend strongly correlates with higher CLV
- Retained customers generate significantly higher lifetime revenue
- Top customers contribute a large share of total revenue
- "high_first_spend" :	27747.08
  "low_first_spend"	: 12403.88
  "mid_first_spend"	: 8153.16

**Decision Implication**  
Investment in **first-purchase experience and early engagement** has compounding long-term revenue impact.

---

## 8. Contribution & Revenue Stability Analysis

**Objective:** Identify revenue drivers and stability risks.

**Key Findings**
- Revenue concentration follows a Pareto-like distribution
- Certain cities disproportionately contribute to revenue
  "top_10_revenue"	"total_revenue"	"top_10_revenue_percent"
        830506.09	      2218273.11	        37.44

**Decision Implication**  
Retention of high-value customers and core categories is **critical for revenue stability**, while geographic insights can guide targeted expansion.

---

## 9. ROI Quantification & Growth Lever Prioritization

**Objective:** Translate insights into financial outcomes.

**Key Finding**
- A 5% retention uplift generates incremental revenue that *outperforms equivalent acquisition* growth at current scale, making retention the dominant growth lever.
- "retained_customers"	"total_customers"	"current_retention_percent"	"projected_revenue_uplift_5_percent_retention"
            91	                98	                  92.86	                            118538.44

**Decision Outcome**  
Retention delivers **higher marginal revenue per customer** than acquisition at current business scale.

---

## 10. Final Business Conclusions

- Revenue stagnation is **not an acquisition problem**
- AOV is flat, limiting pricing-based growth
- Repeat customers drive the majority of revenue
- Early churn is the largest growth bottleneck
- First-month behavior predicts long-term value
- Retention improvements offer the highest ROI
- Retaining high-value customers is cheaper than acquiring new ones

## 11. Skills Demonstrated

This project relies entirely on SQL (no external tools) and includes:

- Multi-level CTE pipelines for staged analysis
- Window functions for time-based comparisons (`LAG`, `RANK`)
- Cohort construction using first-purchase month logic
- Retention and churn modeling via self-joins
- Funnel analysis using conditional aggregation
- ROI simulation using derived retention scenarios
- Business metric definitions embedded in SQL
- Assumption-driven ROI modeling

---

## 12. Tools Used

- PostgreSQL  
- pgAdmin  

---

## 13. Project Positioning

This is a **decision-support business case**, not a query-practice project.

the analysis:
- Starts from executive-level growth questions
- Uses SQL to isolate root causes
- Quantifies financial impact
- Ends with a defensible strategic recommendation

The analysis directly answers:

> *Where should the business invest to unlock sustainable revenue growth?*
