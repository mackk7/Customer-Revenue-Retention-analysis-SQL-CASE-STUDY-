# Customer-Revenue-Retention-analysis-SQL-CASE-STUDY-

## Purpose
This is an e-commerce platform experiencing stagnant revenue growth despite increasing order volume. Leadership wants to know if growth should come from increasing order value, retention, or acquisition.
Using SQL to analyze customer buying behavior, revenue trends, and retention patterns for business decision-making.
## Data
Simulated but behaviorally accurate transactional data with:
- customers
- orders
- order_items

Data is simulated to reflect real-world buying patterns such as repeat business, category leadership, payment methods, and revenue distribution.

## Key Analyses Performed

### Revenue & Growth
- Total revenue and total orders
- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Monthly revenue trends
- Month-over-month revenue growth

### Customer Behavior

- Average time between orders
- First vs repeat purchase revenue
- Funnel analysis based on order count

### Retention & Cohorts
